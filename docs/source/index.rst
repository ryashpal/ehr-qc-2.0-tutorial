EHR-QC-2.0
==========

EHR-Int aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of disease progression by integrating Electronic Health Record (EHR) data with bacterial genomic sequencing data. This approach considers both the host's response (reflected in EHR data) and the characteristics of the pathogen itself (obtained through genomic sequencing). This integrated analysis has the potential to lead to more accurate and informative models for disease progression.
